# Training Web Server
Just the web server for training for getting understanding how web server work internal.

It's make with guide from other resourses. Main resourse is this [**post**](https://osasazamegbe.medium.com/showing-building-an-http-server-from-scratch-in-c-2da7c0db6cb7).
This work only for UNIX-like system because in this project I use just the POSIX specific functions and socket from UNIX.

## Run project

Makefile in this project have 3 simple command:
1. build - build a binary file by g++ compiler
2. run - run the project
3. build-and-run - build a binary and run it
